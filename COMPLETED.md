- Appends: `cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_enable=cpuset`
- Creates backup before modification, skips if already present
- Verified active on all 3 Raspberry Pis after reboot:
  - dwight-pi: âœ… cgroup parameters active (Pi 4, uses `/boot/cmdline.txt`)
  - jim-pi: âœ… cgroup parameters active (Pi 5, uses `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`)
  - michael-pi: âœ… cgroup parameters active (Pi 5, uses `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`)

- Special handling for pam-amd1 VPN gateway (preserve NAT rules)
- Default policy: deny incoming, allow outgoing, allow routed
- Used variables: `tailscale_network_cidr`, `vpn_gateway_ip`
