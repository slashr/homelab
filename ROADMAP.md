# Homelab Development Roadmap

This document tracks all planned work, active projects, and their implementation details.
Each project is broken down into manageable PRs with clear scope, testing, and verification steps.

## PR Workflow

For each PR:

1. ‚úÖ Ensure all tests are green

2. ‚úÖ **Check for Codex review comments** (CRITICAL - don't skip!):

   ```bash
   # Step 1: Check if Codex reviewed
   gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json reviews --jq '.reviews[] | select(.author.login == "chatgpt-codex-connector") | {state: .state}'

   # Step 2: Get inline comments (P1/P2/P3 issues)
   gh api repos/slashr/homelab/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments --jq '.[] | {id: .id, author: .user.login, path: .path, line: .line, body: .body}'
   ```

3. ‚úÖ Address ALL Codex comments:
   - **Fix issues** OR **explain why no fix is needed**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Reply directly to Codex's inline comments (not as independent PR comment) to maintain context
   - Use: `gh api repos/slashr/homelab/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments/<COMMENT_ID>/replies -X POST -f body="..."`
   - If subsequent fixes are pushed, request re-review: `@codex review`

4. ‚úÖ Notify user for final approval

5. ‚úÖ Merge only after user confirmation

## Branch Management

**ALWAYS follow this sequence when starting a new PR:**

1. **Start from main:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create new feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>
   ```

3. **Verify you're on the right branch:**

   ```bash
   git branch --show-current  # Should show feature-branch-name, NOT main
   ```

4. **When checking PR status, ensure you're monitoring the FEATURE BRANCH:**
   - PR checks run against the feature branch
   - Don't switch to main while debugging PR issues
   - Use `git branch --show-current` if confused

5. **If you accidentally start from wrong branch:**
   - Don't push! Rebase onto main first
   - Or delete branch and start over

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- ‚ùå Creating branch from another unmerged feature branch
- ‚ùå Switching to main while debugging PR checks
- ‚ùå Forgetting to pull latest main before branching
- ‚ùå Working on main branch directly

## Deployment Strategy

**Staged Rollout (Preferred for All Changes):**

All Ansible playbooks targeting Raspberry Pis use a staged rollout pattern:

1. **dwight-pi** - catches issues early
2. **jim-pi** - regular worker
3. **michael-pi** - most critical, updated last

**CI/CD Behavior:**

- **PR dry-run**: Checks all 3 Pis simultaneously
- **Main branch apply**: Runs dwight ‚Üí jim ‚Üí michael

**Why:**

- Safer: Issues caught on dwight-pi before affecting workers or master
- Clear: michael-pi updated last as it's most critical
- Fast: Parallel dry-run for quick validation
