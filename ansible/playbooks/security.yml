# Security hardening playbook for public cloud nodes
# Deploys fail2ban and UFW firewall to protect against attacks
#
# Staged rollout order (lowest to highest attack volume):
#   1. toby-gcp1 (2,931 attacks/day)
#   2. phyllis-arm2 (5,825 attacks/day)
#   3. stanley-arm1 (7,907 attacks/day)
#   4. pam-amd1 (VPN gateway - extra caution)
#   5. angela-amd2 (9,228 attacks/day - highest)
#
# Performance optimization: gather_facts: false
# - fail2ban and firewall roles do not use any Ansible facts
# - Skipping fact gathering saves ~4-5 seconds per host
# - Total time saved: ~20-25 seconds across 5 hosts
# - Verified: All tasks use only hard-coded values or inventory_hostname
