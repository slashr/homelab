# Security hardening playbook for public cloud nodes
# Deploys fail2ban and UFW firewall to protect against attacks
#
# Staged rollout order: toby-gcp1 → stanley-arm1 → pam-amd1 → angela-amd2
#
# Performance optimization: gather_facts: false
# - fail2ban and firewall roles do not use any Ansible facts
# - Skipping fact gathering saves ~4-5 seconds per host
# - Total time saved: ~20-25 seconds across 5 hosts
# - Verified: All tasks use only hard-coded values or inventory_hostname
